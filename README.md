# Blockland's Default Scripts Decompiled

These scripts were decompiled using my [DSO decompiler](https://github.com/Electrk/dso.js).  They are logically and functionally accurate, but they ain't pretty.  Decompilation, particularly for DSOs, is tricky and will produce some _unconventional_ code...


### Contributing

If you want to help make the code prettier, feel free to submit a pull request.  The only requirements are that the prettified code is logically and functionally identical (obviously), and that you use **tabs** and the **Allman** brace style.

If you want to separate the larger files into folders and smaller scripts, you can do that too.  Just make sure everything gets executed/defined in the exact same order.
